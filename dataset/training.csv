undefined,What is the most  expensive  thing you've ever bought? — Honestly,
no,Yea I used to have the  X  and had a crazy amount of problems. I have the Max now and it scans perfect almost everytime if you have Sprint and you had the  X  for a year I think you can trade it in for the max with  iPhone  forever and it’ll only be like $4 more  expensive  on your bill,
